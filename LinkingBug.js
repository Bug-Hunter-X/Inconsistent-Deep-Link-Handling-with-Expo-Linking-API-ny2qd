This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links, especially when dealing with multiple deep links or complex URL schemes.  The issue is that the `Linking.addEventListener` might not fire consistently or might miss events, leading to unexpected behavior where deep links aren't handled appropriately. This is often exacerbated by background processing, app state changes, or specific device configurations.  The symptom is that you might receive deep links intermittently or not at all, and the app won't react to them as expected.
